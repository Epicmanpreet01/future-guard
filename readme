# FutureGuard

FutureGuard is a full-stack student dropout risk prediction and intervention platform designed for educational institutions.
It combines **robust data ingestion**, a **rule-based risk engine**, and **machine learning predictions** to identify at-risk students early and provide actionable insights to mentors and administrators.

The system is built with a **role-based architecture** (SuperAdmin, Admin, Mentor), centralized metadata-driven preprocessing, and a decoupled ML microservice.

## Key Features

### 1. Centralized Metadata-Driven Ingestion

- No institute-specific configs or schemas
- Single global metadata schema stored in MongoDB
- Automatic column normalization using:

  - Field keys
  - Display names
  - Synonyms
  - Common naming variations

- Supports CSV and Excel uploads
- Strong validation with early failure on missing required fields

### 2. Hybrid Risk Evaluation Engine

- **Rule-based engine**

  - Deterministic checks on attendance, CGPA, and fees status
  - Provides transparent, human-readable reasons

- **ML model (XGBoost)**

  - Outputs probability of dropout
  - Uses standardized feature vector

- **Final risk = max severity of rule-based risk and ML risk**
- Ensures reliability even when ML confidence is uncertain

### 3. Role-Based Dashboards

- **SuperAdmin**

  - Institute-level aggregations
  - System-wide success tracking

- **Admin**

  - Mentor management
  - Institute analytics

- **Mentor**

  - Upload student data
  - View high-risk students
  - Track improvements (success cases)
  - Detailed per-student explanations and recommendations

### 4. Real-Time Aggregations

- Risk counts (high / medium / low)
- Success tracking (risk reduction over time)
- Aggregations propagate:

  - Mentor → Admin → SuperAdmin

- Fully consistent across updates and re-uploads

### 5. Explainable Predictions

- Each prediction includes:

  - ML risk bucket
  - Rule-based risk bucket
  - Rule reasons
  - Recommendation text

- No black-box outputs

## Architecture Overview

### Backend (Node.js + Express)

- File upload handling
- Metadata normalization and validation
- Student persistence and updates
- Aggregation propagation
- ML service integration

### ML Service (FastAPI)

- XGBoost probability inference
- Rule-based risk evaluation
- Explanation and recommendation generation

### Frontend (React + Tailwind + Recharts)

- Mentor dashboard
- Analytics modals
- Upload history tracking
- Interactive charts:

  - Risk distribution
  - Success vs high-risk comparison
  - Feature-based risk breakdowns

## ML Service API

### `POST /predict`

#### Request

```json
{
  "students": [
    {
      "id": "STU001",
      "features": {
        "attendancePercentage": 62,
        "cgpa": 5.8,
        "feesPaid": false,
        "previousYearPerformance": 55
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "STU001",
      "risk_score": 0.73,
      "risk_label": "high",
      "explanation": {
        "ml_risk": "high",
        "rule_risk": "medium",
        "rule_reasons": ["Fees pending", "Attendance below 60%"]
      },
      "recommendation": "Increase study hours and attend mentoring sessions."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Risk Logic

### Rule-Based Thresholds

- High risk:

  - Attendance < 50%
  - CGPA < 3

- Medium risk:

  - Fees pending
  - Attendance < 60%
  - CGPA < 6

- Low risk:

  - None of the above

### Success Definition

A student is marked as a **success** when:

- Previous risk was `high` or `medium`
- Current risk becomes `low`

---

## Data Privacy & Safety

- No raw student files are stored
- Only standardized, validated fields are persisted
- Student identifiers are controlled and scoped by institute
- ML service is stateless and isolated

---

## Project Status

### Completed

- Centralized metadata system
- Mentor upload and normalization pipeline
- Rule-based + ML hybrid prediction flow
- Aggregation propagation across roles
- Mentor dashboard and analytics
- Upload history and success tracking

### In Progress / Planned

- Model retraining automation
- Advanced explainability (SHAP/LIME)
- Longitudinal trend analytics
- Alerting and intervention workflows
- Deployment hardening and CI/CD
